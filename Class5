1. methods.java
	- Have the class write three for loops to sum the values of 1-10, 20-27, 35-45. 
	- Then introduce to them a method and how much easier it is with methods.

2. definingMethods.java
	- Show the class how to definition a method. Page 179 Yang
		- what is the return type, method name, parameters

	- Show the class only the method and then ask them to try and call the method from the main method. Ask them to compare the numbers 5 and 7 and find out which one is bigger.
		- Then show them the answer

	- Detail how the return works and how we can assign the return to a variable

	- Then show example of a void method and why we would want to use a void method. 

	- Methods cannot have the same name!

3. methodNuances.java
	- Keep the code commented out and let the class find the error in each code block. Then uncomment and show the error.
		- Use to help understand some of the common mistakes made with methods.


4. overloadingMethods.java
	- Here we have two methods with same names, but since they dont have the same return type (different signatures), this is perfectly legal in java. 

	- Add one more method with a type of void and print the result within the method

	- Add one more with three inputs, does anything change?

5. MethodChallenges.java
	- This is a free for all, you can add your own and the class can do these after we're done the above examples. 
		- easy
		- medium
		- hard
			- call a method from main, which in turn calls another method
		- super hard
