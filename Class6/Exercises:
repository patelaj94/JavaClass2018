Exercises:
1. Design a class called Rectange to represent a rectangle. A rectangle will have two fields:
- a double for width
- a double for length.
It should have a method called getArea() that gives you the area of the rectangle.
It should also have a method called getPerimeter() that gives you  the perimeter of the rectangle.
Make an instance of a rectange with width=3, and length 2.

2. Design a class to represent a TV. A TV will have the following fields:
- An integer for the channel
- An integer for the volume
- A double for the screen size
- A string for the manufacturer of the TV
Make a function that increases or decreases the channel of the TV.
Make a function that increases or decreases the volume of the TV.

3. Design a class to represent a stock of a company. The stock will have several fields:
- A String of the stock symbol
- A String of the stock's name
- A double that represents the stocks closing price of the previous day
- A double that represents the stocks current price.
It will also have a method that shows the percentage change in price of the stock from the previous day:
% change = (previous days price - current day's price)/(previous days price)
Now, make a instance of the stock for JPM - J.P. Morgan. Use a previous closing price of 115.53 and a current price of 114.71
