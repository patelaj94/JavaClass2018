Loops:

A loop is for when you want a program to do the same thing multiple times.
-- Hello World Example

They come in three main forms - While, Do-While, and For loops.

Let's go through each.

The while loops is probably the simplest of the three. 
First, make a condition that tells the loop when to run. 
For example, let's say we have an integer less than a certain number and we want the loop to increase the number until they are equal.

Do-While loops are similar - The main difference is that a Do-While loop will always perform the loop tasks at least once.

For loops are a little bit different - We can create a variable inside of a for loop's signature.

Which loop should I use?
The major difference is a pre-test(while, for) versus post-test(do-while) loop. 
They can all do the same things, however, so use the one most comfortable to you.
